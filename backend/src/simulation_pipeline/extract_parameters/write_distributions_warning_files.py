def write_tasks_resources_warning_file(
    warning_dict: dict,
    warning_path: Path
) -> None:
    """
    Write a human-readable warning report for task–resource distributions.

    The function takes the summary dictionary returned by
    `extract_tasks_resources()` and writes a text file describing:

      - The total number of task–resource distributions encountered.
      - How many of them used a fixed ('fix') distribution, and what
        percentage they represent.
      - How many used unsupported distribution types (e.g. 'triang'),
        including their counts and percentages.
      - Explanatory notes on why these distributions were ignored in the
        sensitivity analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    warning_dict : dict
        Output of `extract_tasks_resources()`, expected format:
        {
            "total": int,
            "distributions": [
                {"name": str, "count": int, "pct": float},
                ...
            ]
        }
        The "distributions" list may include an entry for "fix" and
        entries for other unsupported distribution names.
    warning_path : Path
        Full path to the warning file to write, e.g.
        `simulation_results_folder / "warnings_tasks_resources.txt"`.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function writes the file to disk and prints the path; it does
        not return a value.

    """
    Write a human-readable warning report for the arrival-time distribution.

    This function expects the warning dictionary returned by
    `extract_arrival_distribution()` when the arrival distribution is either
    fixed or unsupported for sensitivity analysis. It then writes a small
    text report summarizing the distribution name, status, and message, and
    optionally the fixed value.

    Note
    ----
    Although the type is Optional, this function assumes `warning` is a dict
    with at least the keys "distribution_name", "status", and "message".
    Passing `None` will raise an error because `warning.get(...)` is called
    unconditionally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    warning : dict or None
        Warning dictionary from `extract_arrival_distribution()`, e.g.:
        {
            "distribution_name": "fix",
            "status": "fixed_value",
            "action": "discarded",
            "fixed_value": 0.0,
            "message": "Arrival distribution is 'fix' with value 0.0 and was excluded..."
        }
        or, for unsupported types:
        {
            "distribution_name": "triang",
            "status": "unsupported",
            "action": "discarded",
            "message": "Arrival distribution 'triang' is not supported..."
        }
        Must not be None for this function to work correctly.
    warning_path : Path
        File path where the warning text file will be written.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function writes the file to disk and prints the path; it does
        not return a value.
